# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this new analysis, I looked at the differences in data between the three city types to see any disparities among the different types of cities. I included a data frame with total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. I also included a graph showing the total fares for all three city types.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There were a lot more drivers in urban cities and probably because of this the fares were lower per driver and per ride. Suburban cities had more drivers and riders than rural cities but less than urban cities. Rural cities had the least number of drivers and rides as well as the highest average fares.

The graph shows that while rural cities had the highest fares, the total fares were much higher in urban cities. Suburban cities had higher total fares than rural cities but lower than urban cities.<br>

## Summary: 
We can see that urban cities have a lot more drivers as well as the highest total fares, so one recommendation would be to find a way to hire more drivers in rural and suburban areas. Something else the data shows us is that rural cities have much higher fares, which could be another cause of lower total rides and fares. If rural cities could have lower fares per ride, more people might want to use Pyber in those cities. One final recommendation would be to offer incentives to rural and suburban drivers to encourage them to offer more rides.
